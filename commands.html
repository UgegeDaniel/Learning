        <div>
            document is to Document Object Model (DOM) as window is to Browser Object Model (BOM). And document and everything it has belongs to window. ie. window.documnet, window.alert() etc.
            var cannot be block-scoped but can be function-scoped while let is both. var belongs to the window object let is not. var allows hoisting and allows using a variable before declaring it. let and const allows hoisting but does not allow use before declaring (this will put the variable in a temporal dead-zone)
            Array(n).fill("") will create an array with n empty strings in them
            arrayName.concat(anotherArray) is the same thing as [...arrayName, ...anotherArray] which joins the two arrays. The second one is a form of array destructuring in ES-6. Doing this objects will make the second object's key value override those of existing keys of object 2
            Returning/mutating
            Mutating has to do with changing the value of an array item or object'key value ie. the array or object is being mutated. Some array methods that mutate are .push()
            Return has to do with values gotten from the data in an array or object. Some array methods that return are .push() .map() „Ääused to pick out values in a array „Äã.filter(test function)„Ääused to remove "unstandardized" array members„Äã .find(conditional) „Ääreturns members that return true for the condition„Äã
            .reduce((parameter, iterator)=>{}, starting point) //parameter's value will start at the starting point for the first iteration
            .includes(x) return true or false if array has x as a member
            .some() .every„Ääreturns true or false for a condition„Äã
            .join("choose a separator")
            .forEach does not return anything and does not mutate the array

            .slice and .length
            {...arrayName} changes an array to an object
            Object.keys(objectName) returns an array of the object's keys or use values for values
            Array.from(new Set(arrayName)) which will return an array with no repeated values
            Object keys can be the values of variables by using [variableName] in place of the key. Now if the value of the variable should change, the name of the key will alao change.
            when to use map() and forEach() .reduce()
            De-structuring in JS is a way of assigning values from an array or object using their keys. FOR instance const {x, y, z} = objectName. Now x y and z are keys. Putting :a after x will collect the value from the object, copy it and also assign to a. While putting =a will asign a as a default value to x if there is no index of that reaches where x is in the destructure. a:{b} here a is a key in the object but is in itself an object and b is a key in it. You can also destructure arrays. const [a, b] = arrayName. Now a is equal in value to the 0 index of the array. You can use multiple commas to skip indexes. ... means the remaining elements in the array. [a,,, b, ...rest] here a is 0 index b is 2 indexes after a and rest is the variable that holds the remaining elements in the array. In functions, you can put in a destructured code in place of parameters eg. {x, y, z} or [a, b] inside the parameter brackets. Where x y and z are the keys of the object you want to use in the function
            Promises in JS is a wierd data type that runs asynchronously without obstructing subsequent code ftom running.
            Closure is the ability of a JS function that allows it to access variable outside its scope. 
            Async / Await
            Try / Catch and other error handling
            API is Application Programming interface
            Asynchronous programming does not need the browser to reload for it to run.
            JQuery is basically a DOM manipulation library.
            
            REGULAR EXPRESSION 
            const search = /Regular Expression/gi
            search.test(string) //returns true or false depending on whether there is match of the reg exp
            string.replace(search, newReplacement)
            
            g means global ie not just the first match 
            i means case insensitive 
            üòé? means üòé can occur once or not at all at that position 
            üòç|üòò either one
            [xyz][abc] means the first letters of the words are x or y or z and the second letters are a or b or c
            [a-z] means all letters
            [a-z][a-z][a-z]: means three letters then a colon
            [a-z]{n} means an n number of letters without special characters in between
            [ü§£a-zü§©]{n,m} means n minimum of uninterrupted letters and m maximum (without m but with the comma it is to infinity) 
                {n,} is the same as + while {0,1} is the same as ? [0-9] is the same as \d [a-z] is the same as \w
                üòç could be \s if you want to include spaces in the character set or 0-9 to allow match gor numbers
                ü§£ could be ^ saying the search must start with the character set that follows it 
                put $ at the end of the expression to prevent additional characters after successful match
            use () to group characters ie capturing group. Now when using it as replacement you can use $n to move the () and its contents around where n us the position of the () in the regular expression

        NOTE that you can create a .gitignore file and in the first just type in the files (not forgetting their extensions) that you want git to ignore. To add directories just put a / before the folder name eg. /dir1 all in the same .gitignore file. You can use *.txt to exclude all text files.

            **** make changes  *****
            
        git diff login // this should be done in [master branch] shows the difference between the files the main branch and the branch you are in 
        git merge login // join to the master branch 
        
            do {status, pull request, push}
    //making a pull request 
        1. go to github and click compare and pull, describe pull request and click create pull request (now you can see info on commits and conversation with public and private). 2. resolve conversation and merge 
    
    //MERGE CONFLICTS ???? / STASHING ????
    //if changes were made to the same file to the same line in different branches. What to do so you don't loose the changes you made to your current branch when changing to another branch. 
        1. First commit in the current branch then switch branches. 
        2. attempting to merge will cause git to put in conflict markers in the file (merge conflict). You can fix this conflicts then commit. Note that the markers are put in the version of the files in the new branch.
        
        git branch -d login //delete the login branch

      npm install lodash --save // add dependencies key to json and lodash folder in node modules folder that it created
      npm install lodash -g //this will install lodash globally and in the default directory of node not locally in your project which is actually the default 
      node index.js //this will run the file index.js

      whenever you install a module include the following in ur app
      const _ = require(lodash) //then use it as you wish.

      now you don't want to upload ur folder containing the node modules to a remote server rather, you will need to take your package.json and index.js which is your app and run
      npm install //to install the dependencies in the package.json file.
      dev dependencies eg gulp
      npm install gulp gulp-sass --save-dev //this will install gulp and gulp sass, save them in the package.json devDependencies key

      now running repo folder with your files
      npm install --production //will install the dependencies excluding the dev dependencies which are only needed in development.
      npm unistall gulp --save-dev //will delete the node modules folder and delete the .json dependencies value or remove or rm or un
      npm install lodash@4.17.3 //to install this version of lodash
      npm update lodash //to update lodash to latest version
      npm root -g   //returns the installation location of globally installed packages 
      ctrl c to stop a module from running 
      npm remove gulp --save // deletes gulp from your machinne 
      npm list //shows the packages and depencies in your project
      npm list --depth 0 //shows the packages without their dependencies 
      npm start will run the main in yourpackage.json file though in your script you can change the value of your start to node file.js so that this command runs file.js instead. 
      npm run server //where the value for server in the script in the package.json file is live-server, it will run live-server 
      npx cowsay cowsay node is simple  //this will draw a cow in the terminal that says node is simple. We use npx if the package us executable (if it is, it will be in the bin folder in the node modules). 
      npx create-react-app my-project-name //this will create a new directory with the default react template with all the dependencies installed 
      npm install react-icons //to install react icons 
      npx eslint --init //1. choose third option 2.common js 3.  none of the above (if you are in your server directory) 4. n 5. node 6. air bnb style guide 7. js
      npm i @angular/cli //to install angular 
      ng new projectName 
      

      lowdash version ^8.2.6
      6 is patch which has fixed bugs
      2 minor which has new feature
      8 major which will break your app

      these symbols in the dependencies value of your package.json
      ^ means npm install will install latest minor version
      ~ means npm install will install latest patch version
      * means npm install will install the latest major version (not advisable)
      without any symbol means install only this exact version
      >= means npm install will install any version later than this or this particular version 
      <= means npm install will install any version earlier than this or this particular version
